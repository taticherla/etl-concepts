The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process consists of several stages or steps that are involved in integrating, transforming, and loading data from source systems to target systems. Here are the typical stages of the ETL process:

1. Data Extraction:
   - Identify the source systems or data repositories from which data needs to be extracted.
   - Define the criteria and methods for extracting the required data.
   - Extract data from the source systems using techniques such as querying databases, accessing files, or using APIs.

2. Data Validation and Cleaning:
   - Perform data validation checks to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and integrity.
   - Identify and handle any data quality issues, such as missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies.
   - Cleanse and standardize the data to ensure consistency across different sources.

3. Data Transformation:
   - Map the extracted data to the target data model or schema.
   - Apply business rules, calculations, and transformations to the data.
   - Convert data types, format data, or perform aggregations and calculations as required.
   - Handle data enrichment, integration, and data normalization processes.

4. Data Loading:
   - Determine the target system or database where the transformed data will be loaded.
   - Create the target tables or data structures in the target system.
   - Load the transformed data into the target system using techniques like bulk loading or incremental loading.
   - Handle any data rejection or error scenarios during the loading process.

5. Data Verification and Quality Assurance:
   - Perform data reconciliation to ensure that the loaded data matches the source data and transformation rules.
   - Conduct data quality checks to validate data accuracy, completeness, consistency, and integrity.
   - Verify the transformed data against predefined business rules and expected outcomes.
   - Generate reports or logs to track data processing and identify any discrepancies or issues.

6. Data Archiving and Retention:
   - Determine the data retention policies and archival requirements.
   - Archive or backup the source data and intermediate datasets for future reference or auditing purposes.
   - Purge or delete temporary or unnecessary data to optimize storage and maintain data privacy and security.

7. Error Handling and Exception Management:
   - Define error handling mechanisms to capture and handle errors or exceptions that occur during the ETL process.
   - Implement logging and notification mechanisms to track and report errors for troubleshooting and resolution.
   - Establish processes to handle data rejection, error recovery, and rerun failed processes if necessary.

8. Metadata Management:
   - Capture and manage metadata, which provides information about the data being processed, transformations applied, and data lineage.
   - Maintain documentation and cataloging of metadata to ensure proper understanding and management of the ETL processes.
